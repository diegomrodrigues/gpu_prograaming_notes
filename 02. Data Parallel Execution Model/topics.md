4.1 **CUDA Thread Organization**

*   Hierarchical Thread Structure: Concepts of grids, blocks, and threads within CUDA; the two-level hierarchy of CUDA threads, where a grid consists of blocks, and a block consists of threads, used to divide work and establish execution locality.
*   Built-in Variables:  Pre-initialized variables such as `gridDim`, `blockDim`, `blockIdx`, and `threadIdx`, accessible within kernel functions to determine the thread's position in the execution hierarchy, these variables should not be used for other purposes.
*   Execution Configuration Parameters: Specification of grid and block dimensions during kernel launch, using `<<<>>>`, these dimensions are accessed through built-in variables `gridDim` and `blockDim`.
*  `dim3` Type: Use of `dim3` structure to represent multi-dimensional thread block and grid dimensions, with `x`, `y`, and `z` fields; the ability to set unused dimensions to 1 for 1D and 2D structures for clarity.
*   1D Grid and Block Launch Shortcut: CUDA C shortcut for launching 1D grids and blocks, using arithmetic expressions instead of `dim3` variables to specify dimensions, the CUDA compiler takes the arithmetic expression as the x dimensions and the y and z dimensions as 1.
*   Grid and Block Dimensionality:  Grids and blocks organized as 3D arrays, which can be reduced to 2D or 1D by setting unused dimensions to 1, where the grid can have higher dimensionality than its blocks and vice-versa.
*   Block Size Limitation:  Total number of threads in a block limited to 1024 (for devices with compute capability 2.0 or higher) threads; flexibility to distribute threads among three dimensions while keeping the total below the limit.

4.2  **Mapping Threads to Multidimensional Data**
*   Thread Organization Choice: How the nature of data dictates thread organization as 1D, 2D, or 3D, particularly for processing data like pixels in a 2D array, and the convenience of a 2D grid of 2D blocks.
*   Handling Extra Threads: Use of conditional statements (`if`) in kernels to prevent extra threads from going out of bounds of data arrays, a crucial step since grids and blocks are created in multiples of their dimensions.
*   Dynamic Array Linearization:  Need to explicitly linearize dynamically allocated 2D arrays in CUDA C into 1D arrays due to the limitation of ANSI C standards, a necessity for dynamic data size at runtime, and that this problem may be solved in future CUDA releases.
*   Row-Major Layout: Elements of the same row are placed into consecutive locations; rows are placed one after another in memory. The 1D equivalent index for an element in the j-th row and i-th column is calculated as j*width+i, where width is the number of columns.
*   Column-Major Layout: Contrasting layout where elements of same column are placed into consecutive memory locations, utilized by FORTRAN compilers and how CUDA uses row major layout; awareness that libraries from FORTRAN usually expect column-major layout, a situation that often demands input array transposition to be used from C.
*   `pictureKernel()` Mapping: Thread mapping logic in `pictureKernel()` and how threads process a 2D image; use of `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx` to calculate row and column indices for each pixel.
*   `pictureKernel()` Boundary Condition: How the conditional statement within `pictureKernel()` ensures that all pixels are covered, and that extra threads will not perform any operations out of bounds; how the amount of threads are always a multiple of block dimensions in both axes, so that each dimension has extra threads that are filtered out.
*   3D Array Mapping: How the 2D mapping of threads to data can be extended to 3D arrays, the idea of placing each "plane" one after another and the additional global index calculation needed, to correctly access an element in a 3D array.

4.3 **Matrix-Matrix Multiplicationâ€”A More Complex Kernel**
*   Thread-to-Data Mapping: Extending thread mapping principles to a more complex task of matrix multiplication; how each thread is responsible for one output element in the resulting matrix, and that this thread is mapped to a row and column of the resulting matrix.
*  `matrixMulKernel` Index Calculation: How row and column indices are calculated in `matrixMulKernel()` using `blockIdx` , `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`, the use of global indexes to determine the element in the resulting matrix that the thread is calculating.
*   Inner Product Calculation: Concept of the inner product between a row of one matrix and a column of another for matrix multiplication and the implementation using a for loop inside `matrixMulKernel()` to calculate it.
*   Matrix Tiling: How matrix multiplication is effectively done with tiles, an effect of the thread to data mapping; each block calculates a tile in the resulting matrix.
*    Compile-Time Constant: The use of compile-time constant `BLOCK_WIDTH` to set block dimensions; enabling autotuning process for the block dimensions, to adapt to different hardware.
*   Data Access in Matrix Multiplication: Linearized array access of `M` and `N` within the inner product loop in `matrixMulKernel()`; row-major memory layout and the access patterns to `M` (sequential within the row) and `N` (skipping rows).

4.4 **Synchronization and Transparent Scalability**
*   Barrier Synchronization: Introduction of `__syncthreads()`, a barrier synchronization function that coordinates activities of threads within a block, ensures that every thread completes its phase of execution before continuing, preventing inconsistencies and race conditions.
*   `__syncthreads()` Behavior: How all threads in a block are held at the location of `__syncthreads()` and proceed only when all have reached it, the "No one is left behind" concept for synchronization.
*   `__syncthreads()` Placement Restrictions: CUDA requirements of using `__syncthreads()` inside the `if` blocks or at the end of a branch, all threads either execute the `syncthreads()` or none of them do; else all threads inside a block should execute the same `syncthreads()` instruction, in order to prevent deadlocks.
*   Transparent Scalability: How CUDA allows blocks to execute in any order, since they do not need to synchronize; flexibility that allows for varied execution speeds based on the hardware, supporting implementations across devices with different execution resources, and simplifying development by making the hardware transparent.

4.5  **Assigning Resources to Blocks**
*   Block as Execution Unit: Execution resources are assigned to blocks as a whole unit and all threads in a block share the same resource; guarantee of time proximity for threads in a block during synchronization and to avoid infinite waiting in the barrier.
*   Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs): Organization of hardware execution resources in the form of SMs and how multiple thread blocks can be assigned to them.
*   SM Resource Limits: How each SM has limits on the number of blocks and threads it can handle, and how these limits can vary from one CUDA device to another.
*   Runtime Resource Management: Dynamic block assignment to SMs by the CUDA runtime system, and that the runtime system maintains a list of blocks to be executed and assign them to available SMs.
*   Automatic Resource Reduction: How the CUDA runtime automatically reduces the number of blocks assigned to each SM when resource limits are exceeded, to guarantee correct execution and preventing race conditions.

4.6 **Querying Device Properties**
*   Device Property Querying: Need for applications to query device properties and capabilities for optimal execution, and adaptation to different hardware capacities, and the built-in mechanisms to do so.
*   `cudaGetDeviceCount()` Function: Function to obtain the number of available CUDA devices in the system, to iterate through all devices in the system, and to check for adequate resources.
*   `cudaGetDeviceProperties()` Function: API function that retrieves the properties of a given CUDA device given its ID.
*   `cudaDeviceProp` Structure: Built-in C structure which represents CUDA device properties, such as maximal threads per block, number of SMs, clock frequency and maximum grid and block sizes.
*   Relevant Properties for Execution: Significance of specific `cudaDeviceProp` fields: `maxThreadsPerBlock`, `multiProcessorCount`, `clockRate`, `maxThreadsDim`, and `maxGridSize`. These properties define the computational limits of a given device and are crucial to program execution performance and to decide the parameters of the grid and blocks.

4.7 **Thread Scheduling and Latency Tolerance**
*   Thread Scheduling Context: Thread scheduling as an implementation detail that depends on hardware architecture, and how the concept of warps helps to schedule threads.
*   Warp Size: Use of warps (32 threads) as a unit of thread scheduling in SMs and that warps are not part of the CUDA specification.
*   Warp Execution: How all threads in a warp execute in a SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) manner, meaning that all threads execute the same instruction in different data, each time, and that this dictates execution timing.
*   Streaming Processors (SPs):  How instructions are actually executed in a subset of threads on SPs, and that there are less SPs than the amount of threads in the SM, and that this limitation is what motivates to use a great number of warps.
*   Latency Hiding: Concept of latency tolerance or latency hiding, an strategy of executing other warps while some warps are waiting, in order to fully use the hardware resources.
*   Zero-Overhead Thread Scheduling: Selection of ready warps for execution, preventing idle time and maximizing the execution throughput, and that this is the reason why GPUs do not dedicate chip area to branch prediction and cache memories, as they can hide latency with warps.
*   Block Size Analysis: Importance of choosing suitable block sizes considering device limitations, and how the block size can impact SM occupation and efficiency.
*   SM Occupancy: How the block dimensions dictate the occupation of the SM, and that this should be maximized in order to use the SPs to their maximum potential.
*   Warp Scheduling: How warp scheduling is the key factor in efficiently using execution units, and hiding latencies from long latency operations like memory access.
*   Interplay of Thread and Block Limits: Importance of considering both thread and block limits in SMs when choosing block dimensions for optimal performance, and that there is an interaction of the number of thread blocks and number of threads in each block.
