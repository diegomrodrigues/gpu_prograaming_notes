        "The parallel scan, also known as prefix sum, is an operation that transforms sequential operations into parallel ones, making it fundamental for massively parallel computation. It converts sequential sections of applications into parallel computation. The inclusive scan operation takes an associative binary operator \">+\" and an input array [x0, x1, ..., xn-1], returning an output array with the cumulative results of applying the operator: [x0, (x0 >+ x1), ..., (x0 >+ x1 >+ ... >+ xn-1)]. The prefix sum (scan) inclusive operation receives an associative binary operator \">+\" and an input array [x0, x1, ..., xn-1], returning an output array with the partial sums [x0, (x0 >+ x1), ..., (x0 >+ x1 >+ ... >+ xn-1)].",
        "The exclusive scan operation is similar to the inclusive scan, but returns an array where each element i contains the sum of all elements before i. The output array returned is [0, x0, (x0 >+ x1), ..., (x0 >+ x1 >+ ... >+ xn-2)], where the first element is 0 and the last element reflects the contribution up to xn-2. The prefix sum (scan) exclusive operation is similar to the inclusive one, but returns an array where each element i contains the sum of all elements previous to i. The first element of the output array is always 0, and the last element reflects the contribution up to xn-2. Exclusive scan operation: Similar to the inclusive scan operation, but excludes the current element in the cumulative calculation, i.e., the first element of the output array is zero and the last element reflects the contribution of all elements up to the penultimate one. This operation is useful for obtaining the starting points in memory allocation problems.",
        "The conversion between inclusive and exclusive scan involves shifting the elements and filling with an appropriate value (0 for inclusive -> exclusive, and the sum of the last element for exclusive -> inclusive). The conversion between inclusive and exclusive scan can be done easily with shift operations and filling of elements. To convert from inclusive to exclusive, shift the elements to the right and fill with 0; for the inverse, shift to the left and fill the last element with the sum of the previous last element and the last input element. Conversion between inclusive and exclusive scan: The conversion between the two types of scan can be performed through shift and fill operations. To convert from inclusive to exclusive, shift the elements to the right and fill the first element with zero. The inverse conversion requires shifting to the left and filling the last element with the sum of the original last element and the penultimate one.",
        "Parallel scan is used as a primitive in parallel algorithms such as radix sort, quick sort, string comparison, polynomial evaluation, solving recurrences, operations on trees and histograms, due to its ability to transform sequential operations into parallel ones. Applications of the parallel scan: The parallel scan is used as a primitive in several parallel algorithms, including radix sort, quick sort, string comparison, polynomial evaluation, solution of recurrences, operations on trees and histograms. The choice between inclusive and exclusive scan depends on the specific need of the application, with the inclusive providing the cutting points and the exclusive the starting points."

The in-place parallel scan algorithm operates on an array XY, calculating a reduction tree of the input elements relevant to each output element. The algorithm performs a parallel inclusive scan through a reduction operation for all output elements, creating a reduction tree of the input elements relevant to each output element.",

In iteration n, XY[i] contains the sum of 2^n input elements up to position i. Each thread evolves the content of an XY element, with the kernel performing a scan on a section of the input that is small enough for a block to handle. Each thread evolves the content of an element of the XY array, where XY[i] initially contains the input element xi and, after n iterations, will contain the sum of 2^n input elements up to position i. In-place algorithm: The algorithm operates directly on the input array, modifying it iteratively to contain the scan results. Each thread is responsible for evolving the content of an element of the XY array.",

The kernel is launched with SECTION_SIZE as the block size, ensuring an equal number of threads and section elements, calculating all results as if the array contained only the section elements, with final adjustments for larger input arrays. Implementation of the kernel: Each thread performs a scan on a section of the input, whose size is defined by the constant SECTION_SIZE. The kernel is launched with a number of threads equal to SECTION_SIZE, ensuring that each thread processes an element of the section.",

A barrier synchronization is used to ensure that all threads finish their current iteration of additions in the reduction tree before any of them start the next iteration. A loop iterates through the reduction tree for the array position XY assigned to a thread, using barrier synchronization (_syncthreads()) to ensure that all threads complete their additions before the next iteration. Synchronization and control divergence: The use of '__syncthreads()' ensures that all threads finish their additions before starting the next iteration. Control divergence occurs when some threads finish before others, due to the value of 'threadIdx.x'.",

The use of hardware to execute the parallel kernel needs to be much less efficient, and the extra work consumes additional energy, making the kernel unsuitable for energy-constrained environments. Practical implications: For the parallel kernel to be efficient, it is necessary to have a significantly larger number of execution units compared to the sequential algorithm.

In each iteration, we need to \"push\" the value of the XY element from a position that is a multiple of the stride value minus 1 to a position that is a stride away. The kernel receives an input parameter called stride which begins with the value SECTION_SIZE/2 and is halved with each pass through the loop.
