        "The Compute to Global Memory Access (CGMA) ratio is defined as the number of floating-point calculations performed for each access to global memory within a region of a CUDA program, reflecting the efficiency of memory bandwidth utilization and significantly impacting kernel performance. A higher CGMA ratio indicates better performance due to more computations per memory access.",
        "Modern high-end devices feature a global memory bandwidth of approximately 200 GB/s, limiting the loading rate of single-precision floating-point operands to about 50 giga-operands per second (considering 4 bytes per floating-point value).",
        "For matrix multiplication code to achieve a processor rating of 1,500 GFLOPS, a CGMA value of 30 is required, highlighting the importance of optimizing memory access to improve kernel performance. The desired CGMA ratio has approximately doubled in recent device generations, emphasizing the increasing need for memory access optimization."

        "A thread in modern computers is a virtualized von Neumann processor, consisting of program code, the specific point in the code being executed, and the values of its variables and data structures. Modern processors allow context switching for time-sharing of multiple threads.",
        "Constant memory offers high-bandwidth, low-latency read-only access when all threads simultaneously access the same location, making it suitable for uniform input data in kernels.",
        "Registers and shared memory are on-chip memories that can be accessed at high speed and in a highly parallel manner. Variables in registers are allocated to individual threads, while shared memory is allocated to thread blocks, allowing threads to cooperate by sharing data. The choice of memory type dictates the variable's visibility and access speed.",
        "Global memory in the CUDA programming model corresponds to the von Neumann model's memory and is implemented with off-chip DRAM technology, resulting in longer access latencies and relatively low bandwidth. Arithmetic with operands in registers does not require additional instructions to make the operand value available to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), saving processing time compared to accessing global memory; in contrast, an operand value in global memory requires a memory load operation to be available to the ALU, involving more instructions and taking longer to process.",
        "Shared memory and registers differ significantly in functionality and access cost. Shared memory is designed as part of the memory space residing on the processor chip and can be accessed with much lower latency and much higher bandwidth than global memory."

        "There is an inherent trade-off in CUDA: global memory is large but slow, while shared memory is small but fast. A common strategy is to partition data into subsets called 'tiles' so that each tile fits into shared memory. The term 'tile' is based on the analogy that a large wall (i.e., global memory data) can be covered by 'tiles' (i.e., subsets that can fit in shared memory).",
        "An important criterion is that the kernel computation on these 'tiles' can be done independently of each other; not all data structures can be partitioned into 'tiles' given an arbitrary kernel function.",
        "Tiled algorithms are similar to carpool arrangements, where data values accessed by each thread are considered passengers and requested DRAM as vehicles. When the rate of DRAM requests exceeds the provisioned bandwidth of the DRAM system, traffic congestion arises, and the arithmetic units become idle. If multiple threads access data from the same DRAM location, they can form a 'carpool' and combine their accesses into a single DRAM request.",
        "In matrix multiplication, threads collaborate to load M and N elements into shared memory before using them individually in their dot product calculation. By having threads collaborate on their global memory accesses, traffic to global memory can be reduced. The potential reduction in global memory traffic in the matrix multiplication example is proportional to the dimension of the blocks used. With N\u00d7N blocks, the potential reduction of global memory traffic would be N.",
        "To keep data elements brought back from DRAM in on-chip memory for a long time, waiting for thread 2 to consume them, a large number of data elements will likely need to be kept nearby, hence large on-chip memory requirements.",
        "Barrier synchronization is used to keep the threads that form the 'carpool' group to follow approximately the same execution timing. The basic idea is to have threads collaboratively load the M and N elements into shared memory before using those elements individually in their dot product calculation. Creating these phases is fundamental to the reduction of global memory accesses; with each phase focusing on a small subset of the input matrix values, threads can collaboratively load the subset into shared memory and use the values in shared memory to satisfy their overlapping input needs in the phase. Mds and Nds are reused to hold the input values; in each phase, the same Mds and Nds are used to hold the subset of M and N elements used in the phase. This allows a much smaller shared memory to service most of the global memory accesses; this is because each phase focuses on a small subset of the input matrix elements. When an algorithm exhibits locality, there is an opportunity to use small, high-speed memories to service most of the accesses and remove those accesses from global memory."

        "While CUDA registers and shared memory can be extremely effective in reducing the number of global memory accesses, care must be taken not to exceed the capacity of these memories. These memories are forms of resources needed for thread execution.",
        "Each CUDA device offers a limited amount of resources, which limits the number of threads that can reside simultaneously in the SM for a given application. In general, the more resources each thread requires, the fewer threads can reside in each SM, and thus the fewer threads can reside across the entire device.",
        "Shared memory usage can also limit the number of threads assigned to each SM. For a tile size of 16\u00d716 in matrix multiplication, each block needs 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 4 = 1 K bytes of storage for Mds; another 1 KB is needed for Nds. Thus, each block uses 2 K bytes of shared memory. If each SM can accommodate up to eight blocks, each block should not use more than 2 K bytes of shared memory to achieve this maximum.",
        "Each device generation or model may have a different amount of shared memory in each SM; it is generally desirable for a kernel to be able to use a different amount of shared memory according to the amount available on the hardware.",
        "A kernel can dynamically determine the size of shared memory and adjust the amount of shared memory used by calling the cudaGetDeviceProperties() function. When launching the kernel, the amount of shared memory to be used can be dynamically determined according to the result of the device query and provide this as a third configuration parameter for the kernel launch.",

The Compute to Global Memory Access (CGMA) ratio, which measures the number of floating-point operations per global memory access, is a key determinant of performance. Increasing the CGMA is essential for optimizing kernels.",
        "CUDA offers various memory types to achieve a high CGMA ratio, including global memory, constant memory, registers, and shared memory. Registers and shared memory are on-chip memories that enable fast, parallel access, reducing the need to access global memory. Registers are allocated to individual threads, allowing exclusive access, while shared memory is allocated to thread blocks, enabling threads within the same block to share data efficiently. The choice of memory type affects the visibility and access speed of variables.",
        "Constant memory offers high-bandwidth, low-latency read access, provided all threads access the same location simultaneously. Global memory, while large, has slow access, but its latency and throughput have been improved with caches in newer devices. Global variables are visible to all threads of all kernels and persist throughout execution.",
        "A common strategy for reducing traffic in global memory is to partition data into subsets called tiles that fit in shared memory. The concept of tiling enables kernel computation to be done independently on each tile, reducing the number of global memory accesses. Tiled algorithms are similar to the concept of carpooling: threads accessing the same data from DRAM combine their accesses into a single request, requiring threads to have a similar execution pattern. The use of barrier synchronization ensures that threads follow approximately the same execution timing.",

        "The limited capacity of registers and shared memory can restrict the number of threads that can reside simultaneously in an SM. Excessive use of these resources reduces the number of threads and warps available for scheduling, affecting performance. The amount of registers available per SM varies between devices, and applications can dynamically determine this number to adjust register usage in the kernel.",
        "The CUDA architecture provides multiple memory types to optimize data access, including registers, local memory, shared memory, global memory, and constant memory, each with distinct characteristics of scope, lifetime, latency, and bandwidth. The choice of memory type in CUDA directly impacts the efficiency of data access, with registers and shared memory providing high speed and low overhead, while global memory offers greater capacity but with higher latency.",
        "Optimizing the CGMA is essential to maximize performance in CUDA, seeking to perform more calculations per global memory access, which can be achieved through the efficient use of shared memory and registers. Allocating variables in registers avoids consuming global memory bandwidth, increasing the CGMA and improving performance, but the number of registers per thread is limited.",
        "The use of shared memory allows threads to collaborate by sharing data and intermediate results, reducing traffic in global memory and improving performance. The concept of 'tiling' (or division into blocks) involves partitioning data into smaller subsets that fit in shared memory, allowing threads to work collaboratively on each block to reduce traffic in global memory.",
        "Tiled algorithms require synchronization between threads to ensure that data is loaded and processed correctly in shared memory before being used in calculations. The choice of tile size affects kernel performance, as a too-large tile can exceed shared memory capacity, while a too-small tile may not take full advantage of collaboration between threads.",

After the two tiles of elements M and N are loaded into shared memory, these values are used in the calculation of the scalar product, being that each value in shared memory is used twice. By loading each value from global memory into shared memory so that it can be used several times, the number of accesses to global memory is reduced, which increases the performance.",
